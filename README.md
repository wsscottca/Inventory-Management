# Inventory-Management
Inventory Management for parts and products.

Scenario:
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

They have provided you with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached “GUI Mock-Up”) and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. A system analyst from your company created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section based on the manufacturing organization’s business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
